### I followed the following steps to run this

 - First install mysql server
 - run setup with --schema switch
 - run setup, with a file existing in pdf dir under root dir.
 - specify which labels to extract and their corresponding configurations
or key, value pairs see for example: in pdf_classes.py "Document" class attributes.
 - TODO: study how pdfminer works.
